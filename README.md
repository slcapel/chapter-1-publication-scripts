## Private Allele Tracker ##


This script was designed to detect private alleles among a group of "populations of origin" and their movement and/or persistence in a population of interest.  Tracking movement and persistence of private alleles is a conservative but precise way to track gene flow into a populatin of interest over time as well as detect persistence of unique, local variation following introgression.

## DISCLAIMER: 
This script was designed with data that did not contain fixed differences among populations, rather private alleles occured when a signle population of origin was biallelic at a given locus while all other populations were monoallelic.
