# Private Allele Tracker


This script was designed to detect private alleles among a group of "populations of origin" and their movement and/or persistence in a population of interest.  Tracking movement and persistence of private alleles is a conservative but precise way to track gene flow into a populatin of interest over time as well as detect persistence of unique, local variation following introgression.  This script works exclusively with <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stacks</span> v2.0 and later (Rochette et al. 2019) output files.

## DISCLAIMER: 
This script was designed with data that <ins>did not contain fixed differences</ins> among populations, rather private alleles occured when a signle population of origin was biallelic at a given locus while all other populations were monoallelic.
